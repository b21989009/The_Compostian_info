## GAME

 Researchers develop a formula for solid waste to self-destruct. Yet, an early prototype leaks into landfills and zombifies garbage. Compostians act fast and develop vacuum guns that swallow garbage monsters. They build a facility to separate and process organic material into such compost that fast-forwards plant growth.
Our game lets the player be a Compostian and fight the garbage monsters, exchange garbage for processed compost in the facility, fertilize trees and watch them grow.

In the game, you need to vacuum Garbage Monsters who are attacking you, process them into Compost and feed it to Trees.

Environmental Impact: 

  We would like to propose a solution to a major form of littering: landfills. Landfills are polluting the land, releasing toxins into food and water cycles, releasing methane into atmosphere.  

  The player will be inspired to turn garbage into compost, and fertilize the soil, instead of intoxicating it.
  
  The player will also be able to empathize with waste collectors and their hazardous jobs, therefore will be motivated to recycle.
