GAME

 Researchers develop a formula for solid waste to self-destruct. Yet, an early prototype leaks into landfills and zombifies garbage. Compostians act fast and develop vacuum guns that swallow garbage monsters. They build a facility to separate and process organic material into such compost that fast-forwards plant growth.
Our game lets the player be a Compostian and fight the garbage monsters, exchange garbage for processed compost in the facility, fertilize trees and watch them grow.

In the game, you need to vacuum Garbage Monsters who are attacking you, process them into Compost and feed it to Trees.
