Compostians act fast and develop vacuum guns that swallow garbage monsters. They build a facility to separate and process organic material into such compost that fast-forwards plant growth.
Our game lets the player be a Compostian and fight the garbage monsters, exchange garbage for processed compost in the facility, fertilize trees and watch them grow.
